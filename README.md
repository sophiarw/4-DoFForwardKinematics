# 4-DoFForwardKinematics
This github repository presents the forward kinematics of a 4-DoF parallel mechanism for haptic applications.

The kinematic variables are presented in the paper \[1\] and follow the same notation as \[2\]. This repository includes:

matlab_FKP: the forward kinematics as a Matlab function. All coefficients are consistent with the formulas present in \[1\].
joint_constants: the constants for the origami mechanism presented in \[1\].
mathematica_FKP: a Mathematica file with all of the coefficients for solving the forward kinematics.  All coefficients are consistent with the formulas present in \[1\].
